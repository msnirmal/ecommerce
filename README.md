### **Strategy**

To be in line with UX principles, first i thought  of a strategy to identify who the target users would be and what features they are looking for

Tasks/ ToDo app target users are:

* Aged 15 & over (Can be under 15's with parental permission to use electronics)
* People who love to be organized in term of their tasks 


User requirements:

* Simple and easy to use 
* Basic website with add, edit & delete functionalities

### **Structure**

The structure involves space to add new tasks, button to edit or complete tasks and a button to delete tasks 

## **Features**

---

This app is designed with an intent to help users to easily organize their tasks and update status 

### *Add New Tasks & Submit*

  * Used as the development environment.
  * [Heroku](https://heroku.com/)
  * Used for deployment

## Testing

Testing was done manually during development, no automation created due to time constraints. Will be working this further for enhancement

## Credits

Have used various sources to arrive at the idea of designing the quiz

* You Tube Videos - Some of the code blocks are used following you tube videos of similar apps 
* Stackoverflow (for any error encountered)
* Hello Django walk through project & deployment steps 

## Acknowledgements

* This project could not be completed with authentication functionalities as a result of time contraints & also the fact that i was struggling with initial deployment which resulted in some code breaking, as a result of which i had a create a new repo and copy & paste the codes from the original repo (https://github.com/msnirmal/Portfolio4), which i was planning to submit. I will be working this further to get it up in entirety with authentication functionalities 
  
* The responsiveness of the website is an issue, that i am working to fix 
* Followed agile methodology, however, unfortunately, i lost all the user stories at the time of submission 
* The app needs more work on the aspects above & some more but submitting based on the fact that the main functionalities of add/edit/ compelte/ delete are working fine
